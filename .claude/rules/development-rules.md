# Development Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You ALWAYS follow these principles: **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

## General
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names with a meaningful name that describes the purpose of the file, doesn't matter if the file name is long, just make sure when LLMs read the file names while using Grep or other tools, they can understand the purpose of the file right away without reading the file content.
- **File Size Management**: Keep individual code files under 200 lines for optimal context management
  - Split large files into smaller, focused components/modules
  - Use composition over inheritance for complex widgets
  - Extract utility functions into separate modules
  - Create dedicated service classes for business logic
- When looking for docs, activate `apw:docs-seeker` skill (`context7` reference) for exploring latest docs.
- Use `gh` bash command to interact with Github features if needed
- Use `apw:ai-multimodal` skill for describing details of images, videos, documents, etc. if needed
- Use `apw:ai-multimodal` skill and `imagemagick` skill for generating and editing images, videos, documents, etc. if needed
- Use `sequential-thinking` and `debug` skills for sequential thinking, analyzing code, debugging, etc. if needed
- **[IMPORTANT]** Follow the codebase structure and code standards in `./docs` during implementation.
- **[IMPORTANT]** Do not just simulate the implementation or mocking them, always implement the real code.

## Stack-Specific Skill Activation

Project stack: **Node.js 18+ (ESM) + Express 4 + Socket.io 4** (backend server) · **Vanilla JS + Canvas 2D** (game overlays in `public/games/`) · **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** (dashboard in `public/`) · TikTok Live Connector + TikTool Live (TikTok integration). When working in these areas, activate the matching skill so code follows best practice on first pass.

**Backend skills (activate when editing `src/**/*.js`):**
- `javascript-pro` — modern ES2023+ patterns, ESM modules, async/await, Node.js APIs
- `docs-seeker` — look up latest Express, Socket.io, TikTok connector docs before guessing
- `debug` / `sequential-thinking` — systematic debugging of server-side and real-time issues

**Game / Frontend skills (activate when editing `public/games/**/*` or `public/**/*.js`):**
- `javascript-pro` — Canvas 2D API, browser JS, animation loops, event-driven patterns
- `ui-styling` — CSS layouts, responsive design for OBS overlays (transparent backgrounds)
- `agent-browser` — browser automation for testing game overlays visually

**Cross-cutting:**
- `docs-seeker` — look up latest library/framework docs (context7) before guessing
- `debug` / `sequential-thinking` — systematic debugging and root-cause analysis

### Subagent Spawning Convention

When delegating implementation work to the `apw:fullstack-developer` subagent via the Task tool, the relevant skills above are **already preloaded** in that agent's frontmatter (see `.claude/agents/fullstack-developer.md`). Do NOT repeat skill instructions in the task prompt — just give:

- Task description + acceptance criteria
- Exact file paths to read/modify
- Work context path, reports path, plans path (per `orchestration-protocol.md`)

The subagent will apply the preloaded skills automatically based on the file types it touches.

## Code Quality Guidelines
- Read and follow codebase structure and code standards in `./docs`
- Don't be too harsh on code linting, but **make sure there are no syntax errors and code are compilable**
- Prioritize functionality and readability over strict style enforcement and code formatting
- Use reasonable code quality standards that enhance developer productivity
- Use try catch error handling & cover security standards
- Use `apw:code-reviewer` agent to review code after every implementation

## Pre-commit/Push Rules
- Run linting before commit
- Run tests before push (DO NOT ignore failed tests just to pass the build or github actions)
- Keep commits focused on the actual code changes
- **DO NOT** commit and push any confidential information (such as dotenv files, API keys, database credentials, etc.) to git repository!
- Create clean, professional commit messages without AI references. Use conventional commit format.

## Code Implementation
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Implement features according to specifications
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- **DO NOT** create new enhanced files, update to the existing files directly.

## Visual Aids
- Use `/apw:preview --explain` when explaining unfamiliar code patterns or complex logic
- Use `/apw:preview --diagram` for architecture diagrams and data flow visualization
- Use `/apw:preview --slides` for step-by-step walkthroughs and presentations
- Use `/apw:preview --ascii` for terminal-friendly diagrams (no browser needed to understand)
- Add `--html` to any generation flag for self-contained HTML output (opens in browser, no server needed)
- **Plan context:** Active plan determined from `## Plan Context` in hook injection; visuals save to `{plan_dir}/visuals/`
- If no active plan, fallback to `plans/visuals/` directory
- For Mermaid diagrams, use `/mermaidjs-v11` skill for v11 syntax rules
- See `primary-workflow.md` → Step 6 for workflow integration
